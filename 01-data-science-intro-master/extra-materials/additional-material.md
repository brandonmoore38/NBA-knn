* [A Crash Course in Python for Scientists](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rpmuller/5920182): Read through the Overview section for a quick introduction to Python.
* [Python for Informatics](http://www.pythonlearn.com/book.php): A very beginner-oriented book, with associated [slides](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7X1ycQalUnyal9yeUx3VW81VDg&usp=sharing) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlRFEj9H3Oj4JXIwMwN1_ss1Tk8wZShEJ).
* [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/): Allows you to visualize the execution of Python code.
* [My code isn't working](http://www.tecoed.co.uk/uploads/1/4/2/4/14249012/624506_orig.png) is a great flowchart explaining how to debug Python errors.
* [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is Python's "classic" style guide, and is worth a read if you want to write readable code that is consistent with the rest of the Python community.

**Advanced Python Material:**
* [Want to understand Python's comprehensions? Think in Excel or SQL](http://blog.lerner.co.il/want-to-understand-pythons-comprehensions-think-like-an-accountant/) may be helpful if you are still confused by list comprehensions.
