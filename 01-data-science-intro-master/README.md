### Class 1: What is Data Science

**Sign-ups**
* Sign up for a free account with [Github Public](https://github.com/). Github is an open-source platform for data scientists, programmers and developers, and it's used to share code and learn from others. You will need this account in order to post and share the materials that you will create during our class (especially your midterm and final projects). For example, this is [my profile](https://github.com/austinlasseter).
* Also sign up for a free account with [Github Enterprise](https://git.generalassemb.ly), which is similar to Github Public but is reserved just for us. You will need this account in order to access all of your material for class (these materials are only available to our students, and aren't available to the general public). (If you're reading this you've already done this step!)
* Once you have finishing signing up for Github Enterprise and Github Public, please post your Github username(s) in the "#resources" channel in Slack so that we can start sharing.
* Please sign up for a free account with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), a popular cloud platform for deploying code online. We'll be using Heroku to deploy and share our midterm and final projects as a team. Your username is your email address -- please post this in Slack as well, in the same #resources channel.

**Activity**
* Let's practice giving each other peer feedback in Slack
* Choose any online resource, post the URL in the "#projects" channel with a quick intro, then respond to 2 classmates with a line of feedback on their resource.
* We'll conduct a similar exercise throughout our class -- get in the habit of using Slack for communication and feedback!

**Deploy a Python project in the cloud**

* Check out [the following dashboard](https://flying-dog.herokuapp.com/), created using Python.
* Take a minute to read [this blog post](https://medium.com/@austinlasseter/how-to-deploy-a-simple-plotly-dash-app-to-heroku-622a2216eb73) explaining how to deploy a simple Python project on Heroku.
* Fork [this repo](https://github.com/austinlasseter/flying-dog-beers) on github & let's get started!
* Now try it on your own using [this simple example](https://zoo-animals-dash.herokuapp.com/)
