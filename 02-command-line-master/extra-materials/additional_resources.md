For more information on this topic, check out the following resources:
#### Markdown
* [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) provides a thorough set of Markdown examples with concise explanations.
* GitHub's [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is a simpler and more attractive guide, but is less comprehensive.


#### Command Line
* [Terminal: Mac vs PC](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28487128/what-program-in-windows-is-equivalent-to-oss-terminal)
* [Extra Command Line Practice](http://generalassembly.github.io/prework/cl/)
* If you want to go much deeper into the command line, [Data Science at the Command Line](http://amzn.to/1gSjcvV) is a great book.
* The [companion website](http://datascienceatthecommandline.com/) provides installation instructions for a "data science toolbox"
(a virtual machine with many more command line tools), as well as a long reference guide to popular command line tools.
* If you want to do more at the command line with CSV files, try out [csvkit](http://csvkit.readthedocs.org/), which can be installed via 'pip'.

#### Git and Github
* [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is an excellent book for learning Git. Read the first two chapters to gain a deeper understanding of version control and basic commands.
* If you want to practice a lot of Git (and learn many more commands), [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) looks promising.
* If you want to understand how to contribute on GitHub, you first have to understand [forks and pull requests](http://www.dataschool.io/simple-guide-to-forks-in-github-and-git/).
* [GitRef](http://gitref.org/) is my favorite reference guide for Git commands, and [Git quick reference for beginners](http://www.dataschool.io/git-quick-reference-for-beginners/) is a shorter guide with commands grouped by workflow.
* [Version Control with Git](http://amzn.to/1gSkBm2)
* [Cracking the Code to GitHub's Growth](https://growthhackers.com/growth-studies/github) explains why GitHub is so popular among developers.
* [How to remove .DS_Store from GitHub](https://gist.github.com/vybstat/1680bef4715bfbcb0268)
* [Introducing GitHub](http://amzn.to/1KCjWg6) is a nice intro to GitHub that reads quickly
* [GitHub for Beginners](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1)
