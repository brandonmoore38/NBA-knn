### Class 2: Git, Github, and the Command Line

**Homework Due**
Prior to coming to class, please complete the following:
* Download Anaconda [link](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) onto your laptop. There are lots of ways to get Python, but the Anaconda distribution is considered the industry standard, and will provide you with most of the Python-related resources you’ll need for the class (we’ll discuss a few others on our first day). Be sure to choose the right version for your machine (Mac, PC or Linux) and select “Python 3.7 Version”.
* Download [Atom](https://atom.io/), a popular open-source text editor maintained by Github.
* If your laptop is a Windows PC, download [Git Bash for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). This will not be necessary if you are using a Mac or Linux machine.

**Command Line Resources**
* Work through GA's friendly [command line tutorial](http://generalassembly.github.io/prework/command-line/#/) using Terminal (Linux/Mac) or Git Bash (Windows)
* [Cheat Sheet of Most Popular Commands](https://learntocodewith.me/command-line/unix-command-cheat-sheet/)

**Git and Github Resources:**
* [Understanding the Github workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
* [Getting started with Github](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#intro)
* [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)
* [Additional Resources to Learn Git](http://try.github.io/)

**Jupyter Notebooks**
* [Running the Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html)
